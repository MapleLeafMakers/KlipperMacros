## Neopixel Temperature Indicator
# Source: https://github.com/MapleLeafMakers/KlipperMacros/

# Usage:
# To begin monitoring a temperature:
# SET_LED_TEMPLATE LED=<led_name> [INDEX=<index>] TEMPLATE=temperature_color [param_sensor="'heater_bed'"] [param_cool_temp=20] [param_hot_temp=100] [param_brightness=1.0]
# 
# To stop monitoring a temperature, and resume normal LED control
# SET_LED_TEMPLATE LED=<led_name> [INDEX=<index>]
